# DFASDL - Data Format and Semantics Description Language

The DFASDL is a language based upon [XML
Schema](http://www.w3.org/XML/Schema) that can be used to describe data
formats and additionally the semantics of it.

It is used by the Tensei-Data project to describe data structures and to
derive mappings and transformation functions between different structures
automatically.

This repository contains the core module which consists of the xschema 
definition (xsd) and the official specification.

It is cross build for scala 2.11 and 2.12.
